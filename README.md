🏃‍♂️ FitRoute AI – Step & Calorie Prediction App

📖 Introduction

Walking is a simple yet effective form of physical activity, but the effort required varies depending on route characteristics. FitRoute AI analyzes these variations by applying supervised machine learning (Random Forest Regression) on a synthetically generated dataset. After data preprocessing using label encoding and feature scaling, the trained model is deployed via Streamlit, allowing users to input route details and instantly receive step and calorie predictions. This application helps users understand physical effort and plan walking routes more effectively for fitness and health improvement.
